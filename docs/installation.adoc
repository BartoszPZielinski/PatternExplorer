== Installation

=== Requirements

The code was tested only with https://www.swi-prolog.org/[*SWI Prolog*] (it may not work with other Prolog environments as it uses some non-standard libraries. Also module systems differ between Prolog interpreters). Functor `call_time/2` from 
link:https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=statistics[`statistics`]
module which we use in tests was introduced relatively recently so a year-old installation of SWI Prolog may not have it. 

Execution of the code should not depend on the operating system (it was tested on MacOS X and Windows 10) as it does not use any operating system specific libraries.

Recompilation of documentation requires
